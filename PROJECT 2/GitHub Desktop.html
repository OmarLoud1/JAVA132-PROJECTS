<h2>Programming Project 2</h2>
<h3>Due Friday, October 16 at 11:59pm Cleveland time</h3>

<p><em><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Read the
<strong>Do's and Dont's</strong>
in the <strong>Course Honor Policy</strong> found on Canvas. </em>
</p>

<h3>I. Overview</h3>

<p>This second programming assignment is to give you practice writing loops and manipulating strings and arrays.
<strong>Do not use arrays on a problem involving Strings, and do not use Strings in a problem involving arrays.</strong></p>



<h3>II. Code Readability (20% of your project grade)</h3>

<p>As with the last project, you are required to have code that is easy for another person to read and understand.
To accomplish that, the class will have certain rules about how your code should look.</p>

<p><strong>To receive the full readability marks, your code must follow the following guideline:</strong>
<ul>
<li>You should place a comment at the top of the file that contains your name
and a short description of the purpose of the class.</li>
<li>You should place a <em>short</em> comment before (directly above) each method describing the method.  The comment should
be only describe <em>what</em> the method does, not <em>how</em> it does it.  Do not simply copy the descriptions
below for your comments.</li>
<li>You should place a short comment directly above each field (should you really have any?)
indicating the purpose of the variable.</li>
<li>You should place a short comment above or to the right of each local variable explaining the purpose of the variable.  <em>Variables that are only used as loop indexes do not need to have comments.</em></li>
<li>You should place a short comment above each loop explaining how the loop works.  Ideally, you should list the goal of the 
loop, any required precondition for the loop, and if you can, a good iteration subgoal for the loop.</li>
<li>Any other complicated code such as code the has lots of if statements or variables should contain <em>short</em> comments to help the reader.  The comments can either be above the code fragment or to the right, aligned in a column.</li>
<li>Remember to use good style: everything should be indented nicely, variables should have good names, there should be a blank line between each method.</li>
</ul></p>

<h3>III. Program Testing Document (20% of your project grade)</h3>

<p>As with the previous project, you are required to submit a document demonstrating that you thoroughly tested your program.
In this case, it means documenting tests for each of the methods listed below.
If you are unable to complete a method above, you should still
describe tests that would test the method had it been completed.</p>

<p>Hints for testing loops.  Your tests need to, at the minimum cover the following cases:
<ol>
<li><strong>Test 0, test 1, test many:</strong>  This means you have to test cases where the parameters, if they are integers,
are 0, 1 or some value other than 1.  If the parameters are strings, you have to test strings of length 0, 1, and more than 1.
If the strings must contain certain data, you need to test cases where they contain 0, 1, and more than 1 of the desired data.</li>
<li><strong>Test first, last, and middle:</strong>  In cases where you have to search in or modify a string, you need to test
cases where the item to be found or modified is the first character of the string, the last character of the string, or somewhere
in the middle of the string.</li>
</ol></p>

<p><strong>What must go in the report:</strong> For each method below, your report should describe, in English, what &quot;<em>test 0, 1, many</em>&quot;
and &quot;<em>test first, middle, last</em>&quot; mean for each of the methods.  Then, you should list the specific tests that you will do, what the expected
output is, and then (if you completed the method) a cut-and-paste from DrJava showing the actual test. </p>

<p><strong>JUnit</strong>: you recently learned about JUnit in lab.  JUnit will be required for future homeworks, and you are welcome
to use it with this homework.  If you choose to write JUnit tests for your code,
you do not need to include the actual tests in your report.  Your JUnit file should include comments with each test that link to the report and indicate what
you are testing. For example, if your report indicates that the method requires a test with a string of length 0, your JUnit class should have such a test and
a comment on the test noting that it is the test of a length 0 string that your report described.  Try to organize the JUnit class and report to make it easy for
a reader to jump back and forth between the report and the tests.</p>

<h3>IV. Java Programming (60% of your grade)</h3>

<p><strong>Guidelines for the program</strong>:
<ul>
<li>All methods listed below must be <tt>public</tt> and <tt>static</tt>.</li>
<li>If your code is using a loop to modify or create a string, you need to use the <tt>StringBuilder</tt> class from the API.</li>
<li>Keep the loops simple but also efficient.  Remember that you want each loop to do only one "task" while also avoiding unnecessary traversals of the data.</li>
<li>No additional methods are needed.  
However, you may write additional <em>private</em> helper methods, but you still need to have efficient and simple algorithms. Do not write helper methods that do a significant number of <em>unnecessary</em>
traversals of the data.</li>
<li><strong><em>Important</em></strong>: you must not use either <tt>break</tt> or <tt>continue</tt> in your code.  These two commands are often used to compensate for
a poorly designed loop.  Likewise, you must not write code that mimics what <tt>break</tt> does.  Instead, re-write your loop so that the loop logic does not need break-type behavior.</li>
<li>While it may be tempting to hunt through the API to find classes and methods that can shorten your code, you may not
do that.  The first reason is that this homework is an exercise in writing loops, not in using the API.  The second reason is that in a lot of cases, the API methods may shorten the <em>writing</em> of your code but increase its <em>running time</em>.
The only classes and methods you can use are listed below.  Note: if a method you want to use from the API is not listed, you should <em>not</em> implement the method yourself so you can use it.
Rather, you shoud look for the solution that does not need that method.</p>

<p>You <em>are allowed</em> to use the following methods from the Java API:
<ul><li>class String
    <ul><li>length</li>
        <li>charAt</li>
   </ul></li>
   <li>class StringBuilder
   <ul><li>length</li>
       <li>charAt</li>
       <li>append</li>
       <li>toString</li>
   </ul></li>
   <li>class Character
    <ul><li>any method</li>
   </ul></li>
</ul>
</p>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Create a class called <tt>HW2</tt> that contains the following methods:

<ol>
<li><p><tt>replaceFirstK</tt>:  takes a <tt>String</tt>, two <tt>char</tt>s, and an <tt>int</tt> as input and returns a <tt>String</tt>
that is the same as the parameter <tt>String</tt> except that first <tt>int</tt> occurrences of the first <tt>char</tt> parameter are replaced with the second <tt>char</tt> parameter.
<pre>
> HW2.replaceFirstK("Mississippi River", 'i', 'I', 3)
"MIssIssIppi River"
> HW2.replaceFirstK("Missouri River", 'r', '*', 3)
"Missou*i Rive*"
</pre>
</p></li>

<li><p><tt>allChars</tt>: takes two <tt>char</tt> parameters.  Creates a <tt>String</tt> containing all characters, in order,
from the first <tt>char</tt> parameter (inclusive) to the last (inclusive).
<pre>
> HW2.allChars('d', 'm')
"defghijklm"
</pre>
</p></li>

<li><p><tt>showCharOfString</tt>:  takes two <tt>String</tt> parameters.  Outputs a new <tt>String</tt> that is the same as the
first <tt>String</tt> except that: for each character of the
first <tt>String</tt>, if the character is not in the second <tt>String</tt>, replace that character with the underscore ('_').  
<pre>
> HW2.showCharOfString("Missouri River", "s SR!r")
"__ss__r_ R___r"
</pre>
</p></li>

<li><p><tt>hangman</tt>:  Takes a <tt>String</tt> and an <tt>int</tt> and returns a <tt>boolean</tt>.  The method plays the game of hangman where the <tt>String</tt> is the word
the player must guess and the <tt>int</tt> is the maximum number of "bad guesses" allowed.  The game should work as follows:
  <ol><li>Creates a <tt>StringBuilder</tt> that stores all the letters guessed by the player.  The <tt>StringBuilder</tt> should initially be empty.</li>
      <li>Has a loop that does the following:</li>
      <ol><li>Calls the <tt>showCharOfString</tt> on the parameter <tt>String</tt> and a string containing all the guessed letters.</li>
      <li>Uses <tt>System.out.println</tt> to print the <tt>String</tt> returned from the previous step as well as the total
 number of "bad guesses" so far. (<em>For fun, you can print a graphical hangman instead of the number of bad guesses.</em>)</li>
      <li>Uses <tt>javax.swing.JOptionPane.showInputDialog</tt> to get the next guessed letter from the user. The method should not crash if the user does not enter appropriate data.</li>
      <li>If the letter has not yet been guessed, adds the letter to the <tt>StringBuilder</tt> containing the guessed letters and if the letter is not in the input <tt>String</tt>,
           increases the count of "bad guesses" by one.</li></ol>
      <li>The loop repeats until either: all letters of the parameter <tt>String</tt> are guessed or the number of "bad guesses"
           equals the <tt>int</tt> parameter.</li></ol>
   Finally, the method returns <tt>true</tt> if the player guessed all the letters of the input <tt>String</tt> without reaching the limit on "bad guesses", and false if the "bad guesses" limit was reached.
   You should organize your loop so the return statement is after the loop terminates.</p></li>

<li><p><tt>hiddenString</tt>: takes an array of <tt>char</tt> and a <tt>String</tt> as input parameters and and returns an <tt>boolean</tt>.
The method returns <tt>true</tt> if we can find the input string inside the array by starting at any position of the array
and reading either forwards or backwards.
<pre>
> HW2.hiddenString(new char[]{'a','b','r','a','c','a','d','a'}, "acad")
true
> HW2.hiddenString(new char[]{'a','b','r','a','c','a','d','a'}, "carb")
true
> HW2.hiddenString(new char[]{'a','b','r','a','c','a','d','a'}, "brad")
false
</pre>
</p></li>

<li><p>hiddenString</tt>: takes a 2-dimensional array of <tt>char</tt> and a <tt>String</tt> as input parameters and returns a <tt>boolean</tt>.
The method returns <tt>true</tt> if we can find the input string inside the array by starting at any position of the array and reading in any straight direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonal).
<pre>
> HW2.hiddenString(new char[][]{{'a', 'b', 'c'},{'r','c','a','d'},{'b','r'}}, "bcc")
true
> HW2.hiddenString(new char[][]{{'a', 'b', 'c'},{'r','c','a','d'},{'b','r'}}, "ace")
false
> HW2.hiddenString(new char[][]{{'a', 'b', 'c'},{'r','c','a','d'},{'b','r'}}, "cad")
true
</pre>
</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Extra Credit (up to 10%)</strong><tt>capitalizeWords</tt> takes a <tt>String</tt> as input and returns a <tt>String</tt> as output.  Any word in the input string (a word is defined as a sequence of Enlish letters plus the hypen <tt>-</tt>)
that contains any capitalized letter will have all its letters capitalized in the output string.
<pre>
> HW2.capitalizeWords("Guess what??  There are twenty-sIx letters in the English alphABEt!")
"GUESS what??  THERE are TWENTY-SIX letters in the ENGLISH ALPHABET!"
</pre>
</p></li>
